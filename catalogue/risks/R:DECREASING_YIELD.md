## üß† Description

Over time, lending protocols may produce lower returns due to increased supply, reduced borrowing demand, or protocol changes. This leads to a yield erosion that makes the strategy unattractive or even economically unviable beyond a certain point. This is particularly common during market downturns or after significant incentive programs expire, as capital often remains idle or reallocates elsewhere.

## üß≠ Context

Lending yields are dynamic and depend on the balance between supply and borrow. If more users supply capital or fewer users borrow, the interest rate declines. Protocol incentives may also change, rewards may end, or risk-return ratios shift due to macro conditions.

This risk is especially relevant for passive investors and treasury managers relying on steady yield strategies.

## üîÅ Scope Justification

```LENDING```:
The Lending scope applies because decreasing yield directly impacts lending protocol performance and user retention. Yield erosion affects the economic viability of lending strategies and may trigger capital outflows.

```ASSET```:
The Asset scope applies because yield performance affects the attractiveness and value proposition of yield-bearing assets in a portfolio. Declining yields may justify reallocation to alternative assets.

```APPLICATION```:
The Application scope applies because yield changes can affect user behavior and protocol adoption, potentially leading to reduced platform usage and revenue.

## üéØ Rationale for Action

Yield erosion impacts investor retention, protocol competitiveness, and overall ecosystem health. Continuous monitoring, proactive reallocation, and clear exit criteria are essential for preserving performance and reducing exposure to income decay in DeFi environments.

## üìå Pre-Measure Allocation State

| Protocol  | Asset | Allocation | APY   | Utilization | Risk Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Compound  | USDT   | 70%        | 8.2%  | 81%          | üî¥ High risk due to rising utilization |
| Aave      | USDC   | 30%        | 4.3%  | 42%          | üü¢ Low risk, lower yield |

At the time of assessment, the majority of capital was allocated to Compound due to its significantly higher APY. However, utilization levels rose above 80%, breaching internal thresholds and raising concerns about capital efficiency and risk exposure. Utilization above 80% breaches our internal risk tolerance threshold due to heightened liquidity risk.

## üìà Indicators

- **I:LENDING_APY_TREND**: Lending APY Trend
- **I:UTILIZATION_RATIO**: Utilization Ratio

Combining APY Trend (long-term sustainability) with Utilization Ratio (short-term liquidity risk) provides comprehensive lending risk monitoring.

## üõ† Measures

- **M:REALLOCATE_CAPITAL**: Reallocation to other protocols or chains.
