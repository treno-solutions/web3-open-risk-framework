    Yield erosion does not immediately impact capital, but leads to underperformance.
    In high-utilization environments, the capital becomes illiquid, and yield signals
    may lag behind risk exposure.

### üìä Risk Classification

| **Dimension** | **Rating** | **Explanation**                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Severity      | Medium     | No direct loss, but contributes to systemic underperformance and misaligned portfolio exposure. |
| Likelihood    | High       | Commonly observed in volatile markets or poorly managed lending protocols.                      |
| Persistence   | High       | Unless actively rebalanced, positions tend to degrade slowly but continuously.                  |


Severity is medium because yield erosion typically does not cause immediate capital loss, but high likelihood indicates it frequently impacts returns.

This risk manifests when lending yields appear attractive but are no longer sustainable or aligned with the investor‚Äôs risk tolerance. We illustrate this using two real-world positions:

## üìà Position-Based Evaluation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ USDT on Compound

| **Indicator**           | **Weight** | **Value**    | **Interpretation**                                                         |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `I:LENDING_APY_TREND`   | 1.0        | +4.2% MoM    | Rapidly rising APY, signaling increased borrowing demand or incentives      |
| `I:UTILIZATION_RATIO`   | 0.6        | 94%          | Excessively high utilization, indicating stress on liquidity and risk of lock-ins |

- **Risk Status:** `Escalating`
- **Implication:** The high yield is overshadowed by elevated risk. Liquidity constraints may arise, and the strategy becomes misaligned with a conservative or balanced profile.
- **Triggered Measure:** `M:REALLOCATE_CAPITAL`
- **Action:** Withdraw USDT from Compound and rotate into a more stable protocol.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ USDC on Aave

| **Indicator**           | **Weight** | **Value**    | **Interpretation**                                                   |
|-------------------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `I:LENDING_APY_TREND`   | 1.0        | -1.1% MoM    | Slightly declining APY, but still within acceptable range              |
| `I:UTILIZATION_RATIO`   | 0.6        | 48%          | Healthy protocol balance with adequate liquidity and low stress level  |

- **Risk Status:** `Acceptable`
- **Implication:** The lower yield reflects a safer protocol state. This position fits the target yield-risk ratio better.
- **Action:** Receive capital reallocated from Compound to maintain overall portfolio stability.

## üß≠ Interpretation

This assessment highlights how quantitative indicators can guide real-time capital decisions.
Instead of chasing nominal yield, the framework supports dynamic repositioning based on:
- Risk-adjusted performance
- Indicator deviation
- Liquidity health
- Portfolio alignment

By maintaining yield quality over quantity, investors can avoid common traps in overstretched lending markets.
