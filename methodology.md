# ðŸ§¾ Methodological Foundations

This document outlines how the Web3 Open Risk Framework draws on established risk management standards.  
While we do not claim formal compliance, we intentionally incorporate key principles from traditional frameworks and adapt them to decentralized systems.

---

## âœ… Why this matters

Risk management in Web3 must balance two needs:

- **Structure** â€“ to enable comparability, ownership, and actionability
- **Flexibility** â€“ to reflect the dynamic, modular, and permissionless nature of the ecosystem

By referencing well-known standards, we aim to bridge traditional expectations with crypto-native realities.

## ðŸ“˜ ISO 31000 â€“ Risk Management Principles

| ISO 31000 Principle                        | Applied How?                                               |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Establishing the context                  | `Context` section in each risk definition                  |
| Risk identification                       | Catalog of risks structured by `category`, `scope`, `type` |
| Risk analysis and evaluation              | `Assessment`, supported by `Indicators` and `Investment Objectives` |
| Risk treatment (mitigation)               | Linked `Measures` per risk                                 |
| Communication and consultation            | Markdown format allows shared, versioned documentation     |
| Monitoring and review                     | Indicator weighting enables continuous assessment updates  |

## ðŸ“˜ COSO ERM â€“ Enterprise Risk Management Framework

| COSO Element                    | Applied How?                                                  |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Governance & culture           | `Risk Owner Model` assigns layered accountability             |
| Strategy and objective-setting | `Investment Objective Model` ties risks to investor priorities   |
| Performance and response       | Measures linked to each risk, supporting proactive mitigation |
| Information & communication    | Human-readable and machine-readable templates (Markdown/YAML) |
| Review and revision            | Risks are version-controlled and adaptable                    |

---

## ðŸ“˜ Solvency II â€“ Risk Quantification & Capital Relevance

| Solvency II Element                 | Applied How?                                                   |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Use of quantitative thresholds     | `Indicators` (e.g., Utilization Ratio, APY Trend)               |
| Scenario-based risk evaluation     | Severity/Likelihood/Persistence model in `Assessment`          |
| Risk aggregation and diversification | Can be modeled via Excel correlation overlays                  |
| Capital exposure & risk profiles | `Objectives` include value, yield, cost, and liquidity, as defined in the objective model |

## ðŸ§­ Notes on Adaptation

While these standards are rooted in corporate or regulatory environments, we adapt them for:

- **Transparency over bureaucracy**
- **Decentralized ownership over hierarchical accountability**
- **Observability and composability over static compliance reports**

Our framework is designed to be:

- Actionable for developers and investors
- Verifiable for analysts and dashboards
- Extendable for DAOs, funds, and protocol teams

---

## ðŸ”– Summary

This framework is not a formal translation of ISO, COSO, or Solvency II â€“ but a pragmatic distillation of the parts that matter for operational and strategic decisions in Web3.

By grounding our approach in familiar structures, we create a shared language between risk professionals and crypto-native builders.
