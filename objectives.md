# 🎯 Affected Investment Objectives

This section defines the different **investment objectives** that a risk can negatively influence. Each objective reflects a specific priority for investors – from value preservation to operational safety or regulatory clarity.

A risk entry in the catalogue should specify:

- **Which objective(s)** are at risk
- The **direction of effect**:
  - `INCREASE` – the metric rises in an undesirable way (e.g. COST ↑ → bad)
  - `DECREASE` – the metric drops below the ideal (e.g. TRUST ↓ → bad)
- The **target direction**: whether the objective should ideally increase or decrease

> Note: The model only tracks *undesirable deviations* from the expected or desired state.

## 📊 Purpose and Use

The objectives model serves several key functions:

- It links risks to investor priorities (e.g. value, access, reputation)
- It simplifies risk scoring through **thematic groupings** of objectives
- It helps design targeted **measures** that address specific threats
- It supports intuitive UI elements like filters, badges, or dashboards

## 🧩 Objective Domains and Definitions

### 💰 Financial Objectives  
Risks that directly affect the economic quality or efficiency of an investment.

| Objective   | Description | Goal      | Example |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `VALUE`     | Monetary worth of an asset in base currency. | ↑ Increase | Loss of value due to exploit |
| `YIELD`     | Ongoing returns such as interest or staking. | ↑ Increase | Yield erosion from overuse |
| `COST`      | Operational or transactional expenses. | ↓ Decrease | Gas fee spikes on Ethereum |
| `LIQUIDITY` | Ability to exit or reallocate quickly. | ↑ Increase | Liquidity lock during volatility |

### 🛡 Security Objectives  
Risks that affect safety, accessibility, or resilience.

| Objective    | Description | Goal      | Example |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `LOSS`       | Partial or full capital loss. | ↓ Decrease | Exploit drains protocol treasury |
| `ACCESS`     | Asset mobility and control. | ↑ Increase | Seizure of funds by authority |
| `DEPENDENCY` | Exposure to external service reliability. | ↓ Decrease | Oracle provider downtime |
| `TRUST`      | Perceived system reliability. | ↑ Increase | Confusing or manipulated vote |
| `POTENTIAL`  | Long-term upside and optionality. | ↑ Increase | No roadmap or stagnation |

### ⚖️ Regulatory Objectives  
Risks that influence legal certainty or reputational standing.

| Objective      | Description | Goal      | Example |
|----------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `LEGAL_STATUS` | Alignment with regulatory frameworks. | ↑ Increase | Protocol accidentally offers a security |
| `TRANSPARENCY` | Clarity around governance or ownership. | ↑ Increase | Hidden roles in multisig |

## 🔁 Connection to Measures

Every risk should be linked to one or more **measures** that specifically address the **affected objectives**:

- Which **objective(s)** does the measure aim to protect?
- What is the **direction** of correction or improvement?
- Does the measure help restore the desired target state?

This supports:

- Actionable decision-making  
- Scoring logic in automated tools  
- Communication of mitigation effectiveness

## 📌 Implementation Tip

For dashboards: Highlight the **top 1–3 affected objectives** using tags or icons. Use color coding to signal direction of deviation (e.g. red for trust ↓).

For analysts: Group risks by **objective domain** (financial, security, regulatory) to improve alignment with strategy or audience.
