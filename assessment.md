# 🥮 Risk Assessment Guide

This document defines how to perform consistent, transparent, and meaningful **risk assessments** within the Web3 Open Risk Framework.

The goal is to provide a structured methodology that supports both **qualitative interpretation** and **quantitative evaluation**, depending on the risk type.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

The assessment process helps answer:

- How severe is the risk if it materializes?
- How likely is it to occur?
- How persistent or dynamic is the risk over time?
- Are there any early warning indicators?

Assessments are critical for:

- Prioritization in dashboards or reports  
- Triggering mitigations or alerts  
- Communicating urgency and confidence

## ⚙️ Assessment Parameters

Each risk is evaluated across three key dimensions:

| Dimension       | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Severity**    | How serious are the consequences if the risk materializes? Consider the impact on value, access, trust, regulation, or solvency.        |
| **Likelihood**  | How probable is it that the risk occurs under current or foreseeable conditions?                                                        |
| **Persistence** | Is the risk temporary, recurring, or continuously present? Also captures if the risk is embedded structurally.                          |

Use either a 3- or 5-point scale depending on the complexity of your scoring model.

Example (3-point scale):

| Level | Severity   | Likelihood | Persistence |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1     | Negligible | Rare       | Temporary   |
| 2     | Moderate   | Possible   | Recurring   |
| 3     | Critical   | Likely     | Persistent  |

## 🧾 Accepted Values

Each field in a risk assessment uses a predefined set of values (enums) to ensure consistency across dashboards, reports, and automated systems. These values are **not defined globally**, but directly in the documents that introduce and explain them in context.

For reference:

- **Severity**, **Likelihood**, **Persistence**, and **Risk Status** are defined in this file under *Assessment Parameters* and the corresponding explanation tables.

- **Impact Potential**, **Risk Reduction Scope**, and **Difficulty** are defined in [`measures.md`](./measures.md), where they describe the effectiveness and feasibility of a mitigation strategy.

Each of these enums should be treated as normative and stable. When updating or interpreting a risk or a measure, always refer to the original definition in the respective file.

---

## 🔁 Indicator Integration

If the risk is **quantitative** or **hybrid**, link relevant indicators:

- Assign **weights** to each linked indicator
- Use threshold logic (e.g., 7-day moving average crosses critical value)
- Highlight **deviation from baseline or target**, not just absolute values

---

## 🧠 Qualitative Judgement

For qualitative risks:

- Use a **structured checklist** or comparative case review
- Reference similar risks with known impact
- Involve subject matter experts in protocol governance, security, legal, etc.

---

## 🗂️ Example Output

Each assessment must reference the corresponding risk ID to maintain traceability and version control.

```yaml
assessment:
  riskId: R:DECREASING_YIELD
  date: 2025-05-29
  assessedBy: Analyst-Team A
  severity: CRITICAL              # Enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
  likelihood: POSSIBLE            # Enum: UNLIKELY, POSSIBLE, LIKELY, CERTAIN
  persistence: PERSISTENT         # Enum: TEMPORARY, OCCASIONAL, PERSISTENT
  riskStatus: ESCALATING          # Enum: MONITORED, STABLE, ESCALATING, CRITICAL
  triggeredMeasures:
    - M:REALLOCATE_CAPITAL
  indicators:
    - id: I:UTILIZATION_RATIO
      weight: 0.6
    - id: I:LENDING_APY_TREND
      weight: 1.0
  notes: >
    Yield erosion is already observable. However, user migration is still low,
    indicating early-stage manifestation. Risk is structural and recurring.
```

## 📌 Usage Tips

- Document **why** a score was chosen, not just the score
- Review assessments **periodically** or when indicators change
- Always cross-link to **measures** that aim to reduce severity or likelihood
