# üìÑ Risk Template

Each risk is defined in its own Markdown file using the following structure. This format is both human-readable and machine-parsable, allowing use in dashboards, rule engines, or documentation.

The goal is to capture not only the **what**, but also the **why**, **who**, and how behind each risk.

Fields marked with **(optional)** can be skipped to create a quick, initial version of the risk entry. These can later be completed for a more detailed assessment.

---

## üìù Quick Version

To quickly document a risk, you only need to complete:
- id
- title
- category
- type
- description

The other sections can then be filled in later, based on your priorities or resources.

## üß† Description

Clearly define the risk. What exactly can go wrong? What is the core issue that makes this a threat or vulnerability?

---

## üß≠ Context (optional)

Give background.
Why does this risk exist in the first place? What makes it relevant in Web3 or in this particular setup?

Examples:
- Technical decisions
- Governance structure
- Economic design
- User behavior

## üìà Indicators (optional)

Indicators are defined in a separate file and linked to this risk by ID. Use this section to show the link explicitly here.

---

## üõ† Measures (optional)

Measures are defined in a separate file and linked to this risk by ID. Use this section to show the link explicitly here.

---

## üßÆ Assessment (optional)

Provide a concise evaluation of the risk in terms of severity, likelihood, and persistence.  
This section is meant to help prioritize risks and guide decision-making.

Indicators may be linked to this risk to support a more data-driven assessment.  
Each linked indicator represents a possible signal or measurement for this risk becoming active.

- If a risk has **one indicator**, it is assumed to carry **100% relevance** for triggering this risk.
- If **multiple indicators** are used, they are **collectively weighted**, and each contributes to the likelihood of the risk in practice.

You may also include qualitative remarks on:
- Persistence over time
- Accumulation with other risks
- External dependencies or dynamic thresholds

---

## üîó Related Risks (optional)

List other risks that are similar, derived from this one, or that may compound its effect.
